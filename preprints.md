* Pombo, Olga (2009), [**A Ideia de Enciclopedia (The Idea of Encyclopaedia)**](https://arquivo.pt/wayback/20140930094306/http://www.educ.fc.ul.pt/hyper/ency.htm), hypertext on the most significant historical developments of the encyclopaedic projects and the specificity of philosophical encyclopaedia.

  2. [**Para uma História da Ideia de Enciclopedia** (For the History of the Idea of Encyclopaedia](https://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091224025159/http:/www.educ.fc.ul.pt/hyper/enciclopedia/cap2p1/antclass.htm),
  3. [**Enciclopedia filosófica** (Philosophical Encyclopaedia)](https://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091218065708/http:/www.educ.fc.ul.pt/hyper/enciclopedia/cap3p1/especificidade.htm)
 
* Pombo, Olga (2004), [**Apontamentos sobre Utopia** (Notes on Utopia)](http://webpages.fc.ul.pt/~ommartins/apontamentos/utopia%20geral.htm), historical overview of the main moments, authors and works since the design of the ideal city (16th century) to the imaginary voyage in space (17th century) or in time (18th century) and the prospective optimistic fiction of the future (19th century).  

* Pombo, Olga (ed) (2002) [**Plato's Protagoras**](https://arquivo.pt/wayback/20140930093038/http:/www.educ.fc.ul.pt/docentes/opombo/hfe/protagoras2/index/index1.htm), hypertext on Plato’s "Protagoras", translated and commented. From the main textual *corpus* and the side critical comments provided, a set of links is established that refer to a corresponding set of contextual reading elements considered important, useful, or merely suggestive.

* Pombo, Olga (1995) [**Convite à Leitura de Rousseau** (Invitation to read Rousseau)](https://webpages.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/~ommartins/investigacao/conviteleitura.htm),  hypertext on the diversified dimensions of Rousseau's life and works. The goal is to invite people to read Rousseau, to spread the seed of intellectual and aesthetic pleasure that comes from reading his texts. More specifically, it is about pointing out the diversified aspects under which Rousseau reflected, which remain problematically active among us, and to listen to the echo that his work can still find today in those who engage with it with some care and aim explore some of the many paths it leaves open.

### Image platforms and archives

* Pombo, Olga (ed) (2008) [**Lisbon Center for Image in Science and Art (CISA)**](https://arquivo.pt/wayback/20140927010143/http:/lisboncisa.fc.ul.pt/), image platform and archive intending to question the philosophical, scientific and artistic nature of image. Created in 2008 in the context of the FCT [research project “Image in Science and Art”](https://arquivo.pt/wayback/20140926170450/http:/ica.fc.ul.pt/) that I proposed and coordinated from 2007 to 2012 (see [**here**](https://www.flickr.com/people/lcisa/) what still remains openly available, after the project’s website was [hidden and privately archived](https://cfcul.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/projectos/a-imagem-na-ciencia-e-na-arte/))

* Pombo, Olga (2006), [**Representações da Leitura** (Representations of Reading)](https://webpages.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/~ommartins/album/index.htm), image platform aimig  to collect and display side by side (pictorial) representations of reading, that is, to create a visual assemblage of diverse forms of thinking the act of reading, its associated gestures, quiet postures, silences, solitudes.

* Pombo, Olga (2003), [**Lugares da Escola** (Places of School)](https://webpages.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/~ommartins/images/hfe/lugares/index.html) The aim is to give meaning to the school’s spaces in their architectural configuration, in their internal distribution, to question the sense of their transformations, to look for isomorphisms between material structures and ideas, between topological distributions and mental representations, between functional determinations and conceptual regimes. To uncover the possible continuity amid the variety of forms - a truth that runs across them, a constitutive symbol of the very idea of School.


### Webpages, videos and CDRoms
* Pombo, Olga (coord) (2011), **corpoIMAGEM**, video of the exhibition [**CorpoIMAGEM’ (BodyIMAGE- Representations of the Body in Science and Art**](https://www.pavconhecimento.pt/243/), organized and curated with the collaboration of Catarina Nabais, Cristina Tavares, Manuel V. Alves, Marco Pina, Pedro Silva, Ricardo Reis, Silvia Marco), held at the Pavilhão do Conhecimento - Ciência Viva, Lisboa, 2 February-30 March 2011 (see the [**catalogue of the exhibition**](https://www.pavconhecimento.pt/media/media/754_roteiro-corpoimagem.pdf) and also [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303053499_Roteiro_da_exposicao_corpoIMAGEM_Representacoes_do_Corpo_na_Ciencia_e_na_Arte)).
###### Through images, video, and original music, the exhibition brought together a series of images of the human body from the past 150 years and was based on the study of the collection of anatomical drawings and scientific photography from the Museum of Medicine at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Lisbon, in parallel with the collection of old drawings from the Faculty of Fine Arts at the University of Lisbon ([**exhibition’s press notice**](https://www.pavconhecimento.pt/857/pavilhao-do-conhecimento-ciencia-viva-recebe-a-exposicao-corpo-imagem)). 
The video is divided in 3 parts:

  1.	[**Corpo PAISAGEM. Body Landscape**](http://Lisboncisa.fc.ul.pt/videos/v33.htm) This 1st part covers the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century. It focused on artistic, scientific, and anatomical drawing, the dominant technique in an era when the anatomist and the artist had only charcoal and pencil as their tools for observation
  2.	[**Corpo FRAGMENTO. Body Fragment**](http://Lisboncisa.fc.ul.pt/videos/v33b.htm)
This 2nd part relates to the late 19th and 20th centuries and was marked by photography and X-rays, which came to revolutionize medical knowledge and the pictorial representation of the body. 
  4.	[**Corpo ALGORITMO. Body Algorithm**](http://Lisboncisa.fc.ul.pt/videos/v33c.htm) 
This 3rd part covers the end of the 20th century and the 21st century. In this space, visitors could observe computer-generated images of the body created from numerical data collected through sophisticated imaging techniques, such as 3D ultrasound or functional nuclear magnetic resonance.

### Curated student works  ###### Selection of hypertextual works, most of them produced by undergraduate students in the courses “History and Philosophy of Education” and “Thematic Seminar,” which I taught at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon between 1992–2006 and 1999–2004. The selection, guidance, supervision, and revision, as well as the contextualization and editing of the works signed by the students (each duly identified), were done under my responsibility.
